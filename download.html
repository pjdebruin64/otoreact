  </pageHead>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <h3>Server</h3>
  <p>
    Otoreact does not have any server requirements: any web server serving static files will do.
  </p>
  <h3>Clients</h3>
  <p>
    OtoReact is heavy on JavaScript and requires a pretty modern web browser to run. It does not run in Internet Explorer.
    <br>If you can read this text, then OtoReact is running in your current browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard version is compiled for ECMAScript 2020 and runs in any modern browser version released in 2021 or later.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an alternative version compiled for ECMAScript 2015 (ES5) that should run in older browsers supporting ES5.
    <br>Note that OtoReact is not being tested in older browsers, and performance may be bad.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Downloads</h2>
  <p>
    OtoReact is basically just a single file which you can download here: <a href="{src}OtoReact.js" download>OtoReact.js</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    if you are using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, then you may want these type declarations: <a href="{src}OtoReact.d.ts" download>OtoReact.d.ts</a> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the alternative version for older browsers: <a href="{src}OtoReact_ES5.js" download>OtoReact_ES5.js</a>, <a href="{src}OtoReact_ES5.d.ts" download>OtoReact_ES5.d.ts</a>
  </p>

  <def rvar=donate></def>
  <if cond=donate.V reacton=donate>
    <div style="width:20em;float:right; border:solid 2pt gold; padding:8px">
      <include src="donate.html"></include>
    </div>
  </if>

  <h3>Routing</h3>
  <p>
    If your application uses <a href="routing">Routing</a> on pathnames, then you need to configure your server to serve the same HTML file on different pathnames.
    <br>On Microsoft IIS, it suffices to place this file in your application root: <a href="{src}web.config" download>web.config</a>
    <br>On Apache HTTP Server, it suffices to place this file in your application root: <a href="{src}htaccess.txt">htaccess</a> and rename it to ".htaccess".
  </p>



  <if cond="/dev\//i.test(document.location.href)">
