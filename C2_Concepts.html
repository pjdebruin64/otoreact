<h1>RHTML Concepts</h1>
This chapter introduces a number of basic RHTML concepts, but it also contains full documentation of all features.
<br>Some sections you can skip on first reading are marked with a '*'.


<h2 id=StringInterpolation>String interpolation: text with embedded expressions</h2>
All text content and all HTML attributes inside RHTML code, except scripts, expressions and event handlers that are already JavaScript, may contained embedded JavaScript expressions between braces, like <code>1 + 1 = \{1 + 1}</code>, which results in the text "1 + 1 = {1 + 1}".
<br>This is called <a href="{wiki}String_interpolation">string interpolation</a> or, in JavaScript terminology, 'template literals'.

<p>
    The expressions are evaluated, converted to string, and inserted <i>as text</i>; there is absolutely no risk of <a href="{wiki}Code_injection">code injection</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To include a normal pair of braces in RHTML, at least one of them must be escaped with a backslash.
</p>

<p>Within JavaScript, you can of course use the <a href="{MDN}Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"></a>JavaScript syntax for template literals</a>, using backquotes and dollar signs:</p>
<pre>let x = `Some text ${<i>expression</i>} et cetera`;</pre>
<p>
    If you prefer, you may add a dollar sign in RHTML as well, like <code>1 + 1 = $\{1 + 1}</code>.
</p>
<p>
    * If you set the <a href="#Options">option</a> 'bDollarRequired', then the dollar sign becomes compulsory, and you can write normal braces without a backslash.
</p>
<p>
    Expression values <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are not shown. This is unlike JavaScript template literals, where <code>`$\{null}`</code> yields <code>"null"</code>.
</p>
<p>
    You may omit the expression, like <code>\{}</code>, which comes in handy if you want the parser to not recognize an HTML tag:

<h2 id="ConstructsOverview">RHTML constructs overview</h2>
<p>RHTML defines a number of new <i>constructs</i>, which dynamically build your HTML page:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href=#DEFINE><elm>DEFINE</elm></a> introduces a local variable or reactive variable
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#IF><elm>IF</elm></a> specifies a conditional block of RHTML
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#CASE><elm>CASE</elm></a> specifies a series of alternative conditional blocks of RHTML
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#FOR><elm>FOR</elm></a> specifies a repeating block of RHTML, with a number of additional features
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#COMPONENT><elm>COMPONENT</elm></a> defines a user-defined construct.
        <br>Components may be recursive and may have <i>slots</i>, which are themselves full-fledged constructs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#IMPORT><elm>IMPORT</elm></a> asynchronously imports components defined in a separate file (a <i>module</i>) into your application
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#INCLUDE><elm>INCLUDE</elm></a> asynchronously includes a separate RHTML file into your application
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#RHTML><elm>RHTML</elm></a> dynamically compiles a string as RHTML.
        <br>This is used in the demo component you see on this page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href=#REACT><elm>REACT on</elm></a> optionally allows you to specify which blocks of RHTML should react on which variables, optimizing your application.
        <br>The RHTML attribute <code>reacton</code> does the same thing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#DOCUMENT"><elm>DOCUMENT name</elm></a> defines a separate reactive child document that can be opened in separate (popup) windows, or can be printed without being opened.
    </li>
</ul>
Note: We write construct names in uppercase and attribute names in lowercase here, but as in HTML, both are case independent.


<h2 id="Functions">RHTML functions</h2>
The OtoReact module makes the following functions available for import. They are added to the global environment as well.
<br>The question marks indicate optional arguments.
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>RCompile(HTMLElement, options?)</code> compiles and builds the given HTMLElement as RHTML, using the given <a href=#Options>options</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>RVAR(name?, initialValue?, store?)</code> creates a <a href="#RVAR">reactive variable</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>reroute()</code> and <code>docLocation</code> are used with <a href=#URLRouting>URL routing</a>.
    </li>
    <li id=rangeFunction>
        <code>range(start?, count, step?)</code> yields an iterable range of <i>count</i> numerical values: <i>start</i>, <i>start</i>+<i>step</i>, &hellip;, <i>start</i>+(<i>count</i>-1) * <i>step</i>.
        <br>You can use this with <a href=#FOR><elm>FOR</elm></a>.
    </li>
    <li id=RFetch>
        * <code>RFetch(resource, init?)</code> is the same as <a href="{MDN}Web/API/fetch"><code>fetch(resource, init?)</code></a>, except that it throws an error when an HTTP error status is  received.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    All of these are exported by the OtoReact module. TypeScript type declarations are available on the <a href="download" #onclick=reroute>download page</a>.
</p>


<h2 id=Variables>Local and global variables, 'globalThis'</h2>
Ordinary JavaScript in a browser environment distinguishes between local variables, module variables and global variables:
<ul>
    <li>
        Local variables are visible within a single block <code>\{ &hellip; \}</code> of JavaScript code
    </li>
    <li>
        Module variables are visible within a single module, and may be exported and imported into other modules
    </li>
    <li>
        Global variables are visible in all JavaScript code running in the context of a single browser window:
        <ul>
            <li>Embedded scripts</li>
            <li>External scripts</li>
            <li>HTML inline event handlers</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Browser-based JavaScript also has a distinction between <i>classic</i> JavaScript and <i>module</i> JavaScript, more about that in our <a href=#SCRIPT>section on <elm>SCRIPT</elm></a>.

<h4>RHTML local variables</h4>
<p>RHTML adds another kind of variable: <i>RHTML local variables</i>; these are visible in all <u>inline</u> JavaScript code within a <i>block of RHTML code</i>.</p>
<p>These are introduced by the following RHTML constructs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Constructs <elm>DEFINE</elm> and <elm>SCRIPT type="otoreact/local"</elm> introduce local variable(s) visible in the <u>surrounding</u> block, following the construct closing tag.
    </li>
    <li>
        Constructs <elm>FOR</elm>, <elm>CASE value</elm> with capturing, and <elm>COMPONENT</elm> templates with parameters introduce local variables visible <u>within</u> the construct block.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    RHTML local variable names obey strict <a href="{wiki}Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope">lexical scoping</a> rules, see <a href="#lexicalScoping"><elm>DEFINE</elm></a> for a demonstration.
</p>
<p>RHTML local variables are <u>not</u> visible within other <elm>SCRIPT</elm> embedded or external scripts; these are executed just once in global scope.</p>

<h4>Global variables in RHTML</h4>
Global variables are visible in RHTML inline scripts, of course.
<p>
    Global variables are created:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Either as properties of the JavaScript <a href="{MDN}Glossary/Global_object">global object</a>, which is preferably refered to as <a href="{MDN}Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis"><code>globalThis</code></a>:
        <pre>globalThis.<i>varName</i> = <i>value</i>;</pre>
        In web browsers, the global object is commonly named "<code>window</code>", but in other JavaScript environments it is named otherwise, and using "<code>window</code>" causes confusion with real window properties. Hence ECMAScript 2020 introduced the new cross-platform name <code>globalThis</code> to refer to the global object, and we suggest you use this rather than <code>window</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Or by using the <code>defines</code> attribute of <a href="#SCRIPT"><elm>SCRIPT type="otoreact"</elm></a>.
    </li>
</ul>
    

<h2 id=RVAR>RVAR's: Reactive VARiable's</h2>
<p>
    Reactive variables (RVAR's) are objects containing variable data on which RHTML elements may react.
    <br>Anytime the value of an RVAR changes, the reacting elements will be updated.
</p>
<p>
    RVAR's are created:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>either by calling <code class=sourcecode>RVAR(name?, initialValue?, store?, subscriber?, storename = `RVAR_$\{name\}`)</code> from JavaScript,</li>
    <li>or by using the <a href=#DEFINE><elm>define rvar</elm></a> construct.</li>
</ul>

<h4>RVAR arguments</h4>
<dl>
    <dt><code>name</code></dt>
    <dd>
        If you supply a <code>name</code>, the RVAR will be registered in the global environment under that name and will be visible anywhere.
        <br>So if you write:
        <pre>
    <{}script type=module>
        const x = RVAR('X');
        &hellip;</pre>
        , then it will be available as <code>x</code> just inside this module, and also as <code>X</code> anywhere (though normally one shouldn't use different local and global names).
    </dd>
    <dt><code>initialValue</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Provides the initial value of the RVAR.
        <br>When <code>initialValue</code> is a <a href="{MDN}Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a>, then the value of the RVAR will initially be <code>undefined</code>, and when the promise resolves to a value, then the RVAR will be set to that value.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>store</code>*</dt>
    <dd>
        Provides simple persistence functionality, see <a href="#Persistence">Persistence</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>subscriber</code>*</dt>
    <dd>
        A routine which is <a href="#Subscribe">subscribed</a> to the RVAR, as by <code>x.Subscribe(subscriber)</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>storename</code>*</dt>
    <dd>See <a href="#Persistence">Persistence</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    You may or must inform OtoReact which fragments of RHTML should react on which RVAR's, by using the <a href=#REACT><elm>REACT</elm> element</a> or the <a href=#GlobalAtts><code>reacton</code> attribute</a>, see below.
    <br>For RVAR's created by calling <code>RVAR()</code>, this is necessary.
    <br>For RVAR's created by <elm>DEFINE rvar</elm>, if there are no explicit react's <u>and</u> no other subscribers, then all RHTML code following the <elm>DEFINE rvar</elm>, i.e. the range where the RVAR is visible, <u>will implicitly react</u> on the RVAR.
</p>

<h4>Properties and methods</h4>
<p>An RVAR <code>x</code> is an object, distinct from the value of the variable. It has the following properties and methods:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.V</code></dt>
    <dd>
        To get or set the value of an RVAR <code>x</code>, one writes <code>x.V</code>.
        <br>When <code>x.V</code> is set to a different value than it had before, then the RVAR is marked as dirty, and all RHTML code that reacts on it will be updated.
    </dd>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.U</code></dt>
    <dd>
        When you modify not the value of a RVAR, but properties of the value, you may want the RVAR to be marked as dirty as well.
        <br>You can do this by writing <code class=sourcecode>x.U</code> to get the value of the RVAR.
        <p>E.g., if <code>x.V</code> is an array, you can write <code>x.U.push(e)</code> or <code>x.U[i] = e</code> to add an or modify an array element, and the DOM will react on the modified array. So you don't have to assign to <code>x.V</code> to trigger a reaction.</p>
        <p>Exception: within an HTML attribute or property definition, accessing <code>x.U</code> does not mark the RVAR as dirty. This is so that one can use <code>x.U</code> within RHTML two-way bindings, and the RVAR will only be marked dirty when the property is modified by an event, not when it is being set by the RHTML engine.</p>
        <p>
            Setting <code>x.U</code> sets the value of <code>x</code> and marks it as dirty even when the value is equal to the previous value.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.SetDirty()</code></dt>
    <dd>
        The RVAR can be explicitly set dirty by calling <code>x.SetDirty()</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt id=Subscribe><code class=sourcecode>x.Subscribe(subs, bImmediate?, bInit = bImmediate)</code> *</dt>
    <dd>
        Routine <code>subs</code> is registered as a subscriber to <code>x</code>, so it will be called whenever <code>x</code> has been set dirty.
        <br>When <code>bImmediate</code> is truthy, <code>subs</code> will be called <i>immediately</i> every time <code>x</code> is being set dirty; otherwise it will be called once at the next event cycle.
        <br>When <code>bInit</code> is truthy, then <code>subs</code> will initially be called when it is registered. The default value for <code>bInit</code> is the value of <code>bImmediate</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.UnSubscribe(subs)</code> *</dt>
    <dd>
        Unregisters a routine <code>subs</code> previously registered as a subscriber to <code>x</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.Set(value)</code> *</dt>
    <dd>
        Sets <code>x.V</code> either synchronously, or asynchronously when <code>value</code> is a <a href="{MDN}Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a>.
        <p>
            When it is a Promise, then <code>x.V</code> will initially be <code>undefined</code>, and when the promise resolves to a value, then <code>x.V</code> will be set to that value.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.Set</code> *</dt>
    <dd>
        Provides a routine that sets the value of <code>x</code>, i.e. <code>v => x.Set(v)</code>.
        <p>
            This is handy to create an errorhandler. E.g., if <code>errMsg</code> is an RVAR that should receive error messages, then you can write <code>doSomething().catch(errMsg.Set)</code> to catch the errors of some asynchronous routine, or you can add an attribute <code>#onerror="errMsg.Set"</code> to catch all errors within a block of RHTML.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><code class=sourcecode>x.Clear</code> *</dt>
    <dd>
        Provides a routine that clears the value of <code>x</code>.
        <p>
            You can e.g. add an attribute <code>#onsuccess="errMsg.Clear"</code> to clear any error message when any event handler succeeds without error.
        </p>
</dl>


<h3 id=Persistence>Persistence*</h4>
When you provide a <code>store</code> parameter to <code>RVAR()</code> or to <elm>define rvar</elm>, then the variable value will be retrieved from that store when the variable is created, and stored at every update.
<p><code>store</code> can be:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>sessionStorage</code>, meaning that the value will be restored when the user reloads the page, or leaves it and returns again while staying in the same browser window</li>
    <li><code>localStorage</code>, meaning that the value will be preserved in local browser storage and restored when the user returns to the same site in the same browser on the same machine</li>
    <li>Any other object that supports the <code>setItem</code> and <code>getItem</code> methods of the <a href="{MDN}Web/API/Storage">Storage interface</a>.
        <br>It could be an object that saves values to a database.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The RVAR must have a unique <code>storename</code>; the default is <code>`RVAR_$\{name\}`</code>.</p>

<p>
    An example using <code>sessionStorage</code> can be found in the <a href="#Multiplication">Multiplication demo</a>: modify the numbers; then either reload the page or modify the source code, which triggers a reload too, and see that the modified numbers have persisted.
</p>

<h2>Scripts in RHTML</h2>
<p>
    Scripts can be included anywhere using the <elm>SCRIPT type?</elm> element just as in HTML.
    <br>Depending on the script type, they are either executed just once, or every time the surrounding element is being instantiated (built).
</p>
<p>
    Scripts in OtoReact can export variables, so that these variables are either globally defined or locally visible in RHTML code.
</p>
<p>
    See <a href="#SCRIPT"><{}SCRIPT></a> for details about <elm>SCRIPT</elm> in RHTML.
</p>


<h2>Style sheets</h2>
Style sheets can be included anywhere using the <elm>STYLE</elm> element as in HTML. OtoReact will move them to the document head so they don't get repeated or lost.
<p>
    Styles sheets have global effect, except inside an 'isolated' <a href=#COMPONENT>component</a> or inside <elm>RHTML</elm> text.
    <br>There is no provision yet for style sheets with local scope. To use local styling, just add local class names to each styling rule.
</p>
<p>
    Style sheets inserted with <elm>STYLE</elm> <u>cannot contain interpolated strings</u>, because the HTML parser does not allow that.
    <br>To build up dynamic style sheets using string interpolation and other OtoReact features, you can use <a href=#RSTYLE><elm>RSTYLE</elm></a>.
</p>


<h2>How it works</h2>
OtoReact's <code>RCompile</code> does not, as one might perhaps expect, translate the whole chunk of RHTML into one large string of JavaScript.
<br>Rather:
<ol>
    <li>
        Each snippet of JavaScript is compiled <i>separately</i> into a routine, by offering it to JavaScripts <code>eval</code> function (in global scope, of course).
        <br>E.g., an RHTML property expression <code>a+b</code> is compiled by calling <code>eval("([a,b]) => (a+b)")</code>.
        <p>OtoReact does not itself parse and analyse the JavaScript, so it is unaware which variables are actually used and which are not.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        While traversing the RHTML document tree, all these tiny routines are combined by JavaScript functions into "builder" routines, which can build ór update the DOM tree according to the RHTML. Each RHTML source node corresponds to a separate builder routine.
    </li>
    <li>
        The root builder routine is called to perform the initial build.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each time a builder routine is called to build a DOM node, or a range of DOM nodes, it creates a so-called 'Range' object that refers to the created range of nodes and contains other meta-information as needed. This information is used when the builder routine is called again to update the same range of nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
        While building, any part of the resulting DOM tree which is marked to react on some RVAR, is registered with the RVAR <i>together</i> with its local 'environment' containing the value of all local variables at that point, <i>and</i> a local builder routine which can update just that part of the DOM tree.
    </li>
    <li>
        After the DOM tree has been built, the browser engine will compute the graphical document layout and graphically render its contents.
        <br>It will do so again anytime the DOM tree changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever some RVAR is marked dirty, it will schedule (by <a href="{MDN}Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout"><code>setTimeout</code></a>) all reacting DOM tree parts to get updated by their registered builder routine in its registered environment.
        <br>The updating takes place at the next 'event cycle'.
        <br>While updating, all present HTML elements will remain in place as much as possible, so that any elements that had received focus or input data will keep that.
    </li>
</ol>


<h2>Limitations inflicted by the parser</h2>
Using the browser HTML parser inflicts us some limitations, as it isn't tailored for RHTML. Such as:
<ul>
    <li><b>Element arrangement</b>
        <br>The HTML parser forces elements to be arranged according to HTML rules, and will <i>silently rearrange them</i> if they are not.
        <br>Notably:
        <ul>
            <li>Table-related elements TABLE, THEAD, TBODY, TFOOT, TR may only contain appropriate children.
                <br>The same holds for elements SELECT, DATALIST, OPTION, and perhaps others.
                <br>If, e.g., a <elm>table</elm> would contain a <elm>for</elm> loop containing a <elm>tr</elm>:
                <pre #innertext="
`<table>
    <for let=x of=…>
        <tr> … \{x} … </tr>
    </for>
</table>`"></pre>
                , then the (Chromium) parser will move the <elm>for</elm> <i>before</i> the <elm>table</elm>, while leaving the <elm>tr</elm> inside.
                <br>Thus OtoReact sees:
<pre #innertext="
`<for let=x of=…>
</for>
<table>
    <tr> … \{x}… </tr>
</table>`"></pre>
                , and will give a misleading error about <code>x</code> being undefined.
                <br>To get the loop right, OtoReact allows you to put one (or more) dots after any tag name, so the parser won't recognize this as a table and won't interfere:
                <pre #innertext="
`<table.>
    <for let=x of=…>
        <tr.> … \{x} … </tr.>
    </for>
</table.>`      "></pre>
                When building the DOM tree, the dots will be removed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The paragraph-element <elm>p</elm> does not allow block-level elements inside, but allows unknown elements.
                <br>Thus, if you write
                <pre #innertext="
`<p> … 
<if …><ul> … </ul></if>`
                "></pre>
                , without closing the <elm>p</elm>, perhaps because you know the parser will automatically close it when needed, or because you didn't know block-level element <a href="{MDN}Web/HTML/Element/ul"><elm>ul</elm></a> is not allowed inside <elm>p</elm>, then the parser will silently close the <elm>p</elm> before the <elm>ul</elm> but <i>after</i> the <elm>if</elm>, because <elm>if</elm> is unknown to the parser.
                <br>So the <elm>ul</elm> ends up <i>outside</i> the <elm>if</elm>, without you or OtoReact being informed:
                <pre #innertext="
`<p> … <if …></if></p>
<ul> … </ul>`   "></pre>
                To avoid this, make a habit of always closing all elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Attribute names are always lowercase</b>
    <br>
        As attribute names in HTML are case-insensitive, the parser makes them all lowercase.
        <ul>
            <li>As RHTML sometimes uses attribute names as bound variables, such variables will be lowercase, even if you wrote them with uppercase, and OtoReact can't warn you about this.</li>
            <li>There is also a feature for conditional classes (<code>#class:someclass="someBoolean"</code>), which will only work for class names in lowercase.</li>
            <li>RHTML allows you to use attributes to set DOM and Style properties, but these property names are case sensitive. So OtoReact receives the property name in lowercase and has to restore proper casing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Missing error messages</b>
    <br>
        There are more cases where the browser doesn't inform you of errors, which may result in strange behaviour.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>I imagine Reactive HTML one day being natively supported by the browser. In that case, these limitations can be lifted.</p>

<h3>Problem solving</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    When you get weird errors, you may have forgotten to add dots where needed.
    <br>Otherwise, you may want to check how the browser has parsed your document:
    <ol>
        <li>Outcomment or remove your compiler invocation: <code>// RCompile(&hellip;)</code></li>
        <li>Reload your application</li>
        <li>Inspect the parsed DOM-tree using your browsers development tools. Either:
            <ul>
                <li>Right click in your document and select 'Inspect'</li>
                <li>Press F12 or Ctrl-Shift-I and select tab 'Elements' (Chrome) or 'Inspector' (Firefox)</li>
            </ul>
