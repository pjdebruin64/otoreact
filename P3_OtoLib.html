      The <span class=OtoRed>OtoLib</span> library
  </pagehead>
  <h2>OtoLib.html</h2>
  <p>"OtoLib.html" is a small module containing a few general-purpose components:</p>

  <h3><{}a></h3>
  The <elm>a</elm> component redefines the <elm>a</elm> DOM element, so that any absolute, presumably external, link with no <code>target</code> gets a <code>target='_blank'</code> attribute, so it opens in a new window.
  <br>It also adds rerouting to any relative, presumably internal, link with no <code>target</code>.

  <p>Sample usage:</p>
  <demo #srctext=sampleA></demo>

  <h3><{}radiogroup></h3>
  In HTML, individual radiobuttons (<a href="{MDN}Web/HTML/Element/input/radio"><elm>input type='radio'</elm></a>) are grouped by giving them the same <i>name</i>. When they are on a <elm>form</elm>, and when the form is submitted, then among its formdata will an entry <i>name</i> bound to the value of the radiobutton selected at the moment of submission.

  <p>This is not quite suited for reactive applications, as there is no single property that provides at any moment the value of the currently selected radiobutton.
  <br>Also, it is somewhat tedious having to provide the group name to each button.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <elm>radiogroup</elm> component resolves this by grouping radiobuttons and providing a single reactive two-way property <code>@value</code> to get or set the currently selected radiobutton.
    <br>It also copies the group name to each button, so you have to provide it only once. Or, if you don't use form submission, then no name is needed at all; the group generates its own group name.
  </p>

  <h4>Sample usage:</h4>
  <demo #srcText="demoRadiogroup"></demo>

  <h3><{}checkbox></h3>
  In HTML, a checkbox (<a href="{MDN}Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox"><elm>input type='checkbox'</elm></a>) can have three states: checked, unchecked, and indeterminate, but it doesn't have a single property that in all three cases provides its current state. Instead, it has separate properties <code>checked</code> and <code>indeterminate</code> that are true just when the current state is checked, or indeterminate.

  <p>
    The <elm>checkbox</elm> component resolves this by providing a single two-way reactive property <code>@value</code> that can have three values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>true</code> when the checkbox state is checked</li>
    <li><code>false</code> when it is unchecked</li>
    <li><code>null</code> when it is indeterminate</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Sample usage:</h4>
  <demo #srcText="demoCheckbox"></demo>
