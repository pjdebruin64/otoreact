<h2>What is URL Routing</h2>
    
<p>
    Web applications often contain multiple pages for different purposes, for example an inventory list, inventory details for each item, a customer list, etc.
    
<p>
    A traditional <i>server-side</i> web application utilizes <i>different URLs</i> (page addresses in the navigation bar) to navigate between different pages. 
<p>
    A single <i>client-side</i> web application can blazingly fast provide all these pages by changing its internal state without using different URLs.
    <br>Actually, as the application is fetched as a single document from the server, it natively <i>has</i> just a <i>single URL</i>.
</p>
However, utilizing separate URLs has advantages to the user:
<ol>
    <li>Pages can be individually linked, saved as bookmarks, shared by email or social media, etc.
    <li>The application can be refreshed while staying at the same page
    <li>The browsers back and forward buttons can be used to navigate back and forth
</ol>
Now, <i>URL routing</i> means routing different URLs to different virtual pages, while in the background remaining in one and the same (single page) application.
<p>
    This page itself is presented to you using URL routing. You can quickly move back and forth without anything being fetched from the server, nor being reloaded from cache.
</p>

<h2>Variants of URL routing</h2>
<style scope="local">
    .o {color: deeppink}
    .p {color: slateblue}
    .s {color: limegreen}
    .h {color: orange}
</style>
An (absolute) URL (<a href="{wiki}URL" rel="nofollow">Uniform Resource Locator</a>), like 
"<span class=o>https://otoreact.dev:80</span><span class=p>/some/path</span><span class=s>?param1=A&amp;param2=B</span><span class=h>#someHash</span>", consists of several parts that can be used for routing.
<ul>
    <li>
        The protocol, host, and optional port, together called the '<b>origin</b>' "<span class=o>https://otoreact.dev:80</span>", must remain the same for all pages in an application, and cannot be used for routing.
    </li>
    <li>
        The '<b>pathname</b>' "<span class=p>/some/path</span>" is suited for routing:
        <ul>
            <li>"https://yourdomain.com/inventory" could be your inventory page</li>
            <li>"https://yourdomain.com/customers" could be your customers list</li>
            <li>"https://yourdomain.com/customer/12345" could be the details page for customer 12345</li>
        </ul>
        There are two complications (whatever framework you use):
        <ol>
            <li>
                Web servers by default use the pathname to locate the HTML file being served, and will require special configuration to serve the <i>same</i> HTML file on <i>different</i> pathnames.
                <br>For Microsoft IIS and Apache, this is quite easy: one can put a fixed configuration file in the application directory. Suitable files are included on the OtoReact <a href="download#Routing">download page</a>.
                <br>For other servers, one may have to modify the main configuration file. I have not figured out the details.
                <br>When you are on a shared hosting server, you may not be allowed to modify the server configuration file. In that case, you have to resort to 'search string' routing.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you want to use pathnames composed of multiple segments separated by a slash, like "/customer/12345", then there is a problem when using relative URLs, because they depend on the base path from which the page is loaded, which may vary.
                <p>In OtoReact this can be remedied by inserting <code>\{docLocation.basepath}</code> before the relative URL, to turn it into an absolute URL without hard-coding a fixed base path.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        The optional '<b>search string</b>' "<span class=s>?param1=A&amp;param2=B</span>" is suited for routing too, and does not have the complications listed above.
        <p>
            It must start with a question mark "<span class="s">?</span>", but isn't required to contain parameter name-value-pairs. It can be a path like "<span class=s>?/some/path</span>".
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        The optional '<b>hash</b>' or 'fragment' "<span class=h>#someHash</span>" is suited for routing too, and doesn't have the complications of pathname routing either.
        <p>A drawback is that one then cannot use the hash to create internal document links.</p>
        <p>An advantage is that web and browser document caching will be much better.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How is URL Routing achieved</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        When the pathname is used for routing, then the web server has to be configured to serve the same web application on different pathnames.
        <br>See "Complication 1" above.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the application is opened with a specific URL, the application has to "route" the URL to the correct page definition.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user clicks on a link to a different internal page, then:
        <ol>
            <li>The page request has to be intercepted, so that the browser does not request a new page from the server</li>
            <li>The application state has to be modified to show the correct page</li>
            <li>The new URL has to be shown in the browser address bar and recorded in browser history</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user hits the browser back or forward button, the browser will automatically update the shown URL, but the application must modify its state to show the corresponding page
    </li>
    <li>
        When using the pathname for routing and not only its last segment, then relative links on the page have be avoided, as they depend on the current pathname except its last segment.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>How does OtoReact facilitate URL Routing</h2>
An OtoReact application can implement routing by e.g. a simple <elm>CASE</elm> distinction on the current URL, as it is provided by a special RVAR <a href="docu#URLRouting"><code>docLocation</code></a>.

<p><code>docLocation</code> provides a few additional features, including <code>docLocation.subpath</code>, yielding the current subpath.</p>

<p>
    The <elm>CASE</elm><elm>WHEN</elm> construct also has a feature targeted at URL routing, namely <code>urlmatch</code>.
    It allows matching (part of) a URL to a pattern, and binding local variables to <i>URL-decoded</i> parts of that URL.
</p>

<p>
    Internal links must either have a handler <code>#onclick=reroute</code> to intercept the internal page request, or one must set <a href=docu#Options>option <code>bAutoReroute</code></a>.
</p>

<p>The body of a simple application implementing the URLs listed above could be like:</p>

<pre class="sourcecode" #innertext='
`<body rhtml="bAutoReroute: true">
    <case #value="docLocation.subpath" reacton="docLocation">

        <when urlmatch="/inventory"   src="inventory.html"></when>

        <when urlmatch="/customers"   src="customers.html"></when>

        <when urlmatch="/customer/\{customerNo\}" src=customer.html"></when>
        <!-- Here &apos;customerNo&apos; becomes a local variable bound to the url-decoded part of &apos;docLocation.subpath&apos; after "/customer/" -->
        
    </case>
&lt;/body&gt;`'></pre>
<p>
    See <a href="docu#URLRouting">OtoReact routing facilities</a> for the documentation of all facilities.
