            OtoReact is a library that brings reactivity straight into your HTML file.
            <br>The tiny application above left is the result of this piece of Reactive HTML:
        </p>

        <pre class=sourcecode #innerHTML="ColorCode(sampleGreeting)" style.margion="auto"></pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The Reactive HTML is placed in an HTML document that loads the OtoReact library, e.g. like this: 
        </p>
        <pre class=sourcecode #innerHTML="ColorCode(fileTemplate)" style.margion="auto"></pre>
        <p>
            This code is served to the browser and that's all.
            <p>Full framework functionality offered by a library.
            <p>Nothing to install, nothing to compile, nothing to configure.

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
    '<i>Reactive web applications</i>', or '<a href="{wiki}Single-page_application">Single Page Applications</a>', are web applications that, when possible, react immediately on user input, timer events etc, or the receival of server data requested by the application, instead of having the web server generate and send a new HTML page.
    <br>This results in both a much better user experience and much less server load.
    <br>Two tiny examples you see above; please enter some data.
</p>
<p>
    Reactivity is attained by means of JavaScript programming code running inside the web browser. The JavaScript code has to manipulate the so-called "DOM" ("Document Object Model"), which is the internal object model of a web page ("document").
    <br>Writing such JavaScript by hand can get quite complicated and might result in very cluttered programming code. A <a href="{MDN}Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks"><i>framework</i></a> makes it much easier to create reactive web applications.
</p>
<p>
    <b>OtoReact</i></b> is a small and fast framework library to attain reactivity by loading so-called <b>Reactive HTML</b>, or <b>RHTML</b>, <i>straight into the browser</i>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reactive HTML is based on HTML; JavaScript is needed <i>only for data manipulation and event handling</i>.
        <br>Even <a href="#COMPONENT">components</a> are defined in HTML without a single line of JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Reactive HTML is parsed by the browser itself, and compiled and executed by OtoReact within milliseconds.</li>
    <li>Reactive HTML is easy to learn, and one doesn't need to install a compiler, a bunch of libraries, node.js, or <i>anything</i>.
        <br>Just a text editor (like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) suffices.</li>
    <li>Reactive HTML makes it easy to build dynamic <a href="#colorTable">pages based on data</a>, even if no reactivity is needed.</li>
    <li>Reactive HTML makes it easy to follow the <a href="{wiki}Model–view–controller"><i>Model-view-controller</i></a> design pattern, separating your data model and program logic from the presentation.</li>
    <li>Reactive HTML can build dynamic CSS style sheets; you may not need a separate CSS framework.</li>
    <li>Reactive HTML has a powerful <a href="#COMPONENT">component system</a>, <a. href="./routing" #onclick="reroute">URL routing</a.>, <a href="#onerror">global error handling</a>, some <a href="#Persistence">persistence</a>, et cetera.
        <ul>
            <li>Components are defined right within the HTML, without needing any JavaScript statements</li>
            <li>Components are lightweight and have local scope.</li>
            <li>Components can be (mutually) recursive</li>
            <li>Component definitions can be nested: a component definition can contain its own local component definitions</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>OtoReact can be combined with other tooling: it can be used for fragments of a larger application, and does not modify any native objects (prototypes) which might cause conflicts. It defines a few global variables but does not depend on them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Samples</h2>
<h3>What's your name</h3>
<p>
    Let's return to the tiny example above left. You can modify the source code below and the modified application will be reloaded immediately.
</p>
<demo #srcText="sampleGreeting.replace('><', ` store='sessionStorage'><`)"></demo>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <elm>DEFINE rvar='yourName'</elm> introduces a "reactive variable" <code>yourName</code>, that can contain state information of the application.
        <ul>
            <li><code>yourName.V</code> denotes the value of the variable.</li>
            <li>We have now added <code>store='sessionStorage'</code>, which make sure the value persists when the application is reloaded.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>@value="yourName.V"</code> binds the value of the reactive variable to the value of the input element. Whenever the input element receives input, OtoReact will update the reactive variable and all document content that reacts on it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <elm>IF cond=&hellip;</elm> is an RHTML conditional. Whenever the JavaScript condition is '<a href="{MDN}Glossary/Truthy">truthy</a>', in this case when <code>yourName.V</code> is non-empty, then the body of the conditional is rendered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>\{yourName.V\}</code> and <code>\{yourName.V.length\}</code> are embedded expressions. The rendered document will contain the value of the expression between the braces.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Multiplication">Multiplication tables</h3>
<demo #srctext="demoTables"></demo>
Feel free to increment the numbers!
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <elm>DEF rvar=maxY …</elm> is an abbreviation of <elm>DEFINE …</elm>. It declares a reactive variable <code>maxY</code> with initial value 10, to persist in <code>sessionStorage</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Attributing <elm>INPUT type=number @valueAsNumber=maxY.V</elm> declares that, at any input event, the numeric value of the input element shall be assigned to maxY.V. The rest of the application shall react on the new value.
    </li>
    <li>
        <elm>FOR let=y of="range(1,maxY.V)"</elm> lets local variable <code>y</code> iterate through the values of <code>range(1,maxY.V)</code>, which are the numbers 1 to maxY.V.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<h4>Other frameworks</h4>
<p>
    There exist quite a number of alternative libraries and frameworks to make it easier to build reactive web applications. I distinguish two main categories:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Some, like <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, offer tools to make it easier to manipulate the DOM.
        <br>All manipulation is still done from within the JavaScript you write, and you need a good understanding of DOM manipulation and JavaScript in general.
        <br>The respective libraries can in some cases be loaded straight into the browser without compilation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Others, like <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, make a clean separation between the programming code and presentation. The JavaScript you write contains the data model and data manipulation you need; the actual web page is described by a template file containing HTML enriched with directives and other stuff.
        <br>You don't need to write code to manipulate the DOM at all anymore; this is done by the framework.
        <br>The source code files have to be compiled on you development machine. You need to install the compiler, and quite some modules for each application (which for Angular may take more than 1GB per application).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Reactive HTML combines features of both approaches, giving you the advantages of describing the desired reactive layout by a HTML template, separate from your programming code, but without the hassle of installing and using a compiler and managing quite a number of configuration files, and you need just a basic understanding of JavaScript.
</p>

<h4>Reactive !== Responsive</h4>
<i>Reactive</i> is not the same thing as <i>responsive</i>, though there is some overlap.
<br><a href="{wiki}Responsive_web_design">Resonsive web design</a> is a phrase used to indicate web pages that adapt themselves to the device they are viewed on.
<p>
    This document for example changes its layout when being printed or viewed on a narrow screen: the table of contents moves to the top, and on a mobile device font sizes are adapted.
</p>
<p>
    Responsiveness is usually attained by using <a href="{MDN}Web/CSS/@media">CSS media queries</a>, which is perfectly possible in Reactive HTML.
    <br>When you get stuck with media queries, then reactivity may come to the rescue, to make responsive adaptations to your document or style definitions not possible with media queries.
</p>

<h4>No server-side functionality</h4>
OtoReact does not provide server-side functionality. You need other tooling for that, like Node.js (+ Express), Python, PHP, .Net, or perhaps you can use existing web API's.

<h4>Use file extension .html, not .rhtml</h4>
By using file extension ".html" for RHTML files, file editors can provide HTML syntax features and servers can serve the files just like HTML files without needing additional configuration.
<p>Using ".rhtml" might cause confusion with <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Ruby on Rails</a> HTML files, that are to be processed by the server-side Ruby on Rails engine.

<h2>Document setup</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Download OtoReact.js from the <a href="download" #onclick="reroute">download page</a> and place it somewhere on your server.
        <br>It's less than 50 kilobyte, and has no dependencies at all.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include the OtoReact compiler into your application:
        <pre class=sourcecode><{}script type=module src="OtoReact.js"><{}/script></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Mark the body element of your document with <code class=sourcecode>type="rhtml"</code>:
        <pre><{}body type="rhtml"></pre>
        , then OtoReact will implicitly compile and render the document body at the first event cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may also want to hide all or part of your application until it has been built, e.g. by using:
    <code><{}body type="rhtml" hidden></code>.
        <br>OtoReact will unhide its target after it has been built.
    </li>
</ol>
Or, instead of step 2 and 3, one can explicitly call the OtoReact compiler using the <a href="#Functions"><code>RCompile</code> function</a>:
<pre>
<{}script type=module>
    import \{RCompile, RVAR} from './OtoReact.js';
    RCompile(document.body);
<{}/pre></pre>
This allows one to compile one or more parts of your document, instead of the whole document body, and it allows one to specify additional options

<p>That's all!</p>
