<h2>What is URL Routing</h2>
    
<p>
    Web applications often contain multiple pages for different purposes, for example an inventory list, inventory details for each item, a customer list, etc.
    <br>A traditional server-side web application utilizes different URLs (page addresses in the navigation bar) to navigate between different pages. 
    <br>A single client-side web application can blazingly fast provide all these pages by changing its internal state without using different URLs.
    <br>Actually, as the application is fetched as a single document from the server, it natively has just a single URL.
</p>
Utilizing separate URLs however has advantages to the user:
<ol>
    <li>Pages can be individually linked, saved as bookmarks, shared by email or social media, etc.
    <li>The application can be refreshed while staying at the same page
    <li>The browsers back and forward buttons can be used to move
</ol>
Now, JavaScript has features to simulate different page addresses

<h2>How is URL Routing achieved</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        The web server may have to be configured to serve the same web application on supported URLs
    </li>
    <li>
        When the application is opened with a specific URL, it has to show the correct page
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user moves to a different page, then:
        <ol>
            <li>The page request has to be intercepted, so that the browser does not request a new page from the server</li>
            <li>The new URL has to be shown in the browser address bar and recorded in browser history</li>
            <li>The applicaton state has to be modified to show the correct page</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        When the user hits the browser back or forward button, the browser will automatically update the shown URL, but the application must modify its state to show the corresponding page
    </li>
</ol>
